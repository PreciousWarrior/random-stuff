# random-stuff

This repository contains tiny programs/scripts for which it doesn't make sense to have a dedicated repository for. 

A lot of these files are not organized in their correct directories, because I simply cannot identify what they were created for. The repository is also incomplete since my local file system is a mess and there are a few programs probably hidden somewhere that I was not able to find. (I need to do some spring cleaning!)

Most of these programs are for finding a solution to a mathematical/computational problem I was intrigued about, automating simple things, etc. It also contains a few TXT/JSON/CSV files that I use frequently in my projects. Shell scripts that I use for my rofi menus and automating stuff on my Linux Desktop can be found in the dotfiles repository.
